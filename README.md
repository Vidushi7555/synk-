Project 1: Push-Up Counter Using OpenCV and Mediapipe in Python

The goal of this project is to use computer vision techniques, such as OpenCV and Mediapipe, to accurately count the number of push-ups performed by a user. The project uses a camera to capture a video of the user performing push-ups, and then uses OpenCV to identify and track the user's movements. Mediapipe is then used to analyze the movements and determine the number of push-ups performed.

The project is implemented in Python, making use of the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to perform the computer vision tasks. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily start and stop recording, and to view their progress. The project is designed to be highly accurate and reliable, using advanced computer vision techniques to accurately count push-ups, even in noisy or cluttered environments.

Project 2: Yoga Posture Corrector Using OpenCV and Mediapipe in Python

The goal of this project is to use computer vision techniques, such as OpenCV and Mediapipe, to help users ensure that they are performing yoga postures correctly. The project uses a camera to capture a video of the user performing a yoga posture, such as the T-pose or the Tree posture, and then uses OpenCV to identify and track the user's movements. Mediapipe is then used to analyze the movements and determine if the posture is being performed correctly.

The project is implemented in Python, making use of the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to perform the computer vision tasks. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily start and stop recording, and to view their progress. The project is designed to be highly accurate and reliable, using advanced computer vision techniques to accurately assess yoga postures, even in noisy or cluttered environments.
